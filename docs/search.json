From 1960-2000 there was an upward trend in the percentage of the foreign-born U.S. population (9.7 million to 31.1 million people respectively). Since 1970 there has been rapid growth, with 4.7% of the U.S. population being foreign-born in 1970 and, as of 2013, that number is up to 13.1%. In addition to this general increase, the demographic of the people migrating to the U.S. is different (what the data set we are looking at breaks down). A significant factor in this shift is the passage of the Immigration and Nationality act of 1965, which eliminated national or origin quotas and allowed immigrants from non-European countries to begin immigrating. For example, the top country in 1960 and 1970 which sent immigrants was Italy, and from 1980-2013 it is now Mexico. This research article then further investigates the state members of the foreign-born population live in, the language they speak, their age, and the amount of time they have spent living in the U.S.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nWhile our research will build on this idea of examining, this article focuses on other internal domestic variables while we will focus mainly on the trends of people migrating. We intend to investigate further the trends this article touches on regarding the increased growth in immigration overall and the resulting change in demographics of that increased immigration population."

Based on previous match success, FiveThirtyEight updates what they call a SPI, or Soccer Power Index for each team that encompasses the relative strength of each team. Because goals do not always accurately reflect the performance of teams in an individual game, FiveThirtyEight bases their SPI on a stat called adjusted goals, which adjusts for overall team performance. With SPI, FiveThirtyEight predicts the percentage chance a match ends in a win for either team or in a draw. They also predict expected goals for each match. This part is not relevant to our research, but they also forecast the odds of teams winning the league they compete in based on their record and SPI strength.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nThe article describes how their model is derived.
